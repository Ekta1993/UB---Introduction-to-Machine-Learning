The task was to find similarity between the handwritten samples of the known and the questioned writer by using linear regression.
Each instance in the CEDAR “AND” training data consists of a set of input features for each handwritten “AND” sample. The features are obtained from two different sources:
1. Human Observed features: Features entered by human document examiners manually
2. GSC features extracted using Gradient Structural Concavity (GSC) algorithm.

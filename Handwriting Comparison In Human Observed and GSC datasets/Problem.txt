Problem is to find similarity between the handwritten samples of the known and the questioned writer by using linear regression.
Each instance in the CEDAR “AND” training data consists of set of input features for each hand- written “AND” sample. The features are obtained from two different sources:
1. Human Observed features: Features entered by human document examiners manually
2. GSC features: Features extracted using Gradient Structural Concavity (GSC) algorithm.
The target values are scalars that can take two values {1:same writer, 0:different writers}. Although the training target values are discrete we use linear regression to obtain real values which is more useful for finding similarity (avoids collision into only two possible values).

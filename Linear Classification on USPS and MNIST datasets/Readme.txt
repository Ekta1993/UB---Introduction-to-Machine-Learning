Extract feature values and labels from the data: Download the MNIST dataset from the Internet and process the original data file into a Numpy array that contains the feature vectors and a Numpy array that contains the labels.
Data Partition: The MNIST dataset is originally partitioned into a training set and a testing set. You will use this partition and train your model on the training set.
Train model parameter: For a given group of hyper-parameters such as the number of layers and the number of nodes in each layer, train the model parameters on the training set.
Tune hyper-parameters: Validate the classfication performance of your model on the vali- dation set. Change your hyper-parameters and repeat step 3. Try to find what values those hyper-parameters should take so as to give better performance on the testing set.
Evaluate on testing sets: Test the trained models on both MNIST test set and USPS data. Discuss your findings.


p.s: You may download USPS data set online.

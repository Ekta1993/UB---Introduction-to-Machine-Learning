Evaluate each solution on the test set using classification accuracy,
Acc = Ncorrect , (1)
N
where Ncorrect is the number of corrected classified data samples, and N is the total number of samples of the validation set. Under the 1-of-K coding scheme, each data sample will be assigned a class label as
C = argmax yi, (2) where y âˆˆ RK is the output probability distribution over classes.
2. Construct a confusion matrix for each classifier and observe the relative strengths and weaknesses.
3. Evaluate the performance of the ensemble classifier.

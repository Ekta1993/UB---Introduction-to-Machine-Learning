Evaluate the performance of the brain implemented using a neural network having 2 hidden layers on the basis of the next action taken by the agent considering the current state.
Evaluate the action on the basis of the highest Q value returned by the state chosen by the agent.
Performance of the epsilon curve and thus exponential decay to determine how quick our agent is learning by exploring the environment.
Evaluation of mean reward our agent has earned during the total number of episodes.

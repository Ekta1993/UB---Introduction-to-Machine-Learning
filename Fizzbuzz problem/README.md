Fizzbuzz problem

In this task an integer divisible by 3 is printed as Fizz, and integer divisible by 5 is printed as Buzz. An integer divisible by both 3 and 5 is printed as FizzBuzz. If an integer is not divisible by 3 or 5 or 15, it simply prints the input as output (for this last case, the input number can be classified as Other in Software 2.0, it should then be handled using Software 1.0, which prints the input as output).
Your programs will be tested on how well they perform in converting integers from 1 to 100 to the FizzBuzz labels.
